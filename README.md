SVG is an underrated web technology and the SVG1K project intend to show case how far it's possible to go when creative creators are limited to 1Ko of data.

If you are a web developer, you should consider contributing to this project, it's a fun way to show your creativity as well as your technical skills while learning new stuff.

Be creative, be smart, show your skills!

## Contribute

Contribution is super easy if you follow this steps:

1. Create a amazing standalone, non-compressed, SVG file which is less or equal than 1Ko (1024 characters). By standalone we mean it must be understood as a valid SVG file by web browsers, in other words you don't need to add the xml prologue but you must add the SVG namespace on the outermost SVG element.

2. Create a pull request against that repository with your SVG file within the `img` folder and the details of your submission within the `js/entries.js` file (the name of your file, your name/pseudo for credits and an optional link)

3. Wait for review and brag when it's merged.

## FAQ

### I don't understand Git, can I contribute without making a PR?

Of course, making a GitHub PR is the easiest and fastest way for us to review and provide feedback, but it isn't a hard requirement. Feel free to create your kick ass SVG demo anywhere you want (for example, [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/), [dabblet](https://dabblet.com/), [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), etc.), then if you have no one around you that could handle the PR for you, feel free to ping @JeremiePat (either by opening an issue, on twitter, or by e-mail)  to get your submission included.

### Can I submit any crapy SVG like a simple circle?

We do not have any formal acceptance criteria, but we expect you to push forward the limit of the technology. As a consequence we cannot guaranty that your contribution will be accepted if we subjectively judge it's not impressive enough. That said we will do our best to provide constructive feedback on your PR to improve your submission in a way it can be accepted.

### 1Ko is too small, can I contribute with a larger file?

Currently we want to get stick to 1Ko, however we are considering to change that limit or to create new categories at some point in the future. Please convince us that your submission is so crazy and push the limit of the technology so fare that we should accept it.

### Can I submit a compressed SVG file (with the extension `.svgz`)?

No, in this context, compression provides no value. One of the intent of the SVG1K project is to be used by web developers as a pedagogic resource to learn new technics with SVG (either by learning from the demos or by submitting PRs that will be reviewed thoroughly). Because compression is a form of hard obfuscation it goes against that pedagogic intent.
